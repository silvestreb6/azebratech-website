        <p>Claim denials are not a billing inconvenience. They are a structural revenue crisis that is getting worse every year. In 2024, the U.S. healthcare industry lost an estimated $262 billion to denied claims (Bulwark Health / industry data). That figure is not a projection — it is the sum of claims that were submitted, rejected, and in many cases never resubmitted. For individual practices and health systems, denials represent a steady, compounding drain on revenue that most organizations underestimate by a factor of three to five.</p>

        <p>This article presents the current data on claim denial rates, the verified costs of denial rework, a documented case study of a health system that cut denials by 42%, and a practical automation playbook for preventing denials before they occur. Every number is sourced and cited. The goal is not to sell you on automation as a concept — it is to give you the data you need to calculate exactly how much your organization is losing and what it would take to stop the bleeding.</p>

        <p>If your organization is already grappling with the broader administrative burden that drives denials, our analysis of <a href="/blog/healthcare-admin-crisis-automation/">the healthcare admin crisis</a> provides additional context on the systemic forces at work.</p>

        <h2 id="denial-epidemic">The Denial Epidemic: $262 Billion Lost in 2024</h2>

        <p>The scale of the denial problem is no longer debatable. The data from multiple independent sources converges on the same conclusion: denial rates are rising, the cost per denial is rising, and the percentage of denials that are never recovered is holding steady at catastrophic levels.</p>

        <p>According to Experian Health's State of Claims 2025 report, based on a survey of 250 revenue cycle leaders, the initial claim denial rate reached 11.8% in 2024, up from 10.2% in prior years (<a href="https://www.experian.com/healthcare" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Experian Health, State of Claims 2025</a>). That may sound like a modest increase in percentage terms. In dollar terms, it is enormous. At an industry level, Bulwark Health and multiple industry analyses estimate that $262 billion in claims were denied in 2024 alone.</p>

        <p>The problem is not isolated to a few underperforming organizations. The Experian survey found that 41% of healthcare providers now report denial rates of 10% or higher, up from 30% in 2022. This is not a tail-end problem affecting outliers — it is a systemic shift affecting nearly half the industry. Meanwhile, HFMA's Pulse Survey data shows that hospitals lose an average of 4.8% of net revenue to denials (<a href="https://www.hfma.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HFMA Pulse Survey</a>). For a hospital with $200 million in net patient revenue, that is $9.6 million per year walking out the door.</p>

        <p>Three numbers frame the magnitude of this problem:</p>

          <div class="stat-highlight cyan">
            <div class="stat-number">$262B</div>

            <div class="stat-label">Of denied claims never resubmitted (high-end estimate)</div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>The trajectory is clear. Denial rates are climbing, payer requirements are tightening, and the administrative infrastructure at most healthcare organizations has not kept pace. The organizations that treat denials as a systemic problem — rather than a billing department problem — are the ones producing measurably different results.</p>

        <h2 id="why-denials-happen">Why Claims Get Denied: The 5 Root Causes</h2>

        <p>Understanding why claims get denied is the prerequisite for preventing them. The data points to five root causes that account for the vast majority of initial denials. Each one has a specific automation-based solution — which is why denial prevention, not denial management, is the higher-leverage strategy.</p>

        <h3>1. Incorrect Patient Demographics and Registration Errors</h3>

        <p>This is the single largest driver of claim denials. According to Experian Health's 2025 survey, 68% of providers cite inaccurate or incomplete patient data as a leading cause of denials (<a href="https://www.experian.com/healthcare" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Experian Health, 2025</a>). A misspelled name, a transposed digit in a policy number, an outdated address — any one of these can trigger an automatic rejection from the payer's system.</p>

        <p><strong>How automation prevents it:</strong> Automated patient access tools verify demographics against payer databases in real time at the point of registration. Discrepancies are flagged before the claim is ever submitted. The OhioHealth case study (detailed below) demonstrates exactly this approach, reducing registration-related denials by 42%.</p>

        <h3>2. Eligibility and Coverage Verification Failures</h3>

        <p>Claims submitted for patients who are not eligible for coverage on the date of service are automatically denied. This includes lapsed coverage, termed insurance policies, and coordination of benefits (COB) errors where the wrong payer is billed as primary. These are entirely preventable denials — the information exists in payer systems, but most practices do not check it systematically before rendering services.</p>

        <p><strong>How automation prevents it:</strong> Automated eligibility verification runs batch checks against all major payers 24 to 48 hours before scheduled appointments. Patients with coverage issues are flagged for front-desk follow-up before they arrive. Real-time checks at registration catch same-day changes. OhioHealth reduced termed insurance denials by 69% and COB denials by 36% using this approach.</p>

        <h3>3. Coding and Documentation Errors</h3>

        <p>According to Altruis, 49% of claims are affected by routine coding and documentation issues (<a href="https://www.altruis.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Altruis</a>). This includes incorrect CPT or ICD-10 codes, mismatched diagnosis-procedure combinations, missing modifiers, and insufficient specificity in code selection. Coding errors are particularly expensive because they often require clinical review to resolve, not just administrative correction.</p>

        <p><strong>How automation prevents it:</strong> Automated claim scrubbing engines check every claim against payer-specific rules, CCI edits, LCD/NCD requirements, and historical denial patterns before submission. Claims that fail any rule are routed to coders for correction before they ever reach the payer. This shifts the cost from post-denial rework ($57 per claim) to pre-submission correction (seconds of automated processing).</p>

        <h3>4. Missing or Delayed Prior Authorization</h3>

        <p>Services rendered without the required prior authorization are denied outright by most payers. The authorization requirement landscape has become increasingly complex, with different payers requiring authorization for different services, different thresholds for different plan types, and different submission deadlines. Staff who manage authorizations manually cannot keep up with the volume and variability.</p>

        <p><strong>How automation prevents it:</strong> Authorization management platforms automatically determine whether a service requires prior auth based on the patient's specific plan, submit authorization requests electronically, track status, and escalate approaching deadlines. The key is the "determination" step — automation eliminates the risk of staff not knowing that an authorization was required in the first place.</p>

        <h3>5. Insufficient Clinical Documentation</h3>

        <p>Payers increasingly deny claims on the basis that the clinical documentation does not support the medical necessity of the service billed. This is particularly common in high-cost procedures, inpatient admissions, and specialty services. The documentation may be present in the medical record but not structured or detailed enough to meet the payer's specific requirements.</p>

        <p><strong>How automation prevents it:</strong> AI-powered clinical documentation improvement (CDI) tools analyze documentation in real time, flagging gaps in medical necessity support, missing specificity in diagnoses, and incomplete procedure narratives before the claim is coded. Some platforms integrate directly with EHR workflows, prompting clinicians to add required details at the point of care rather than after the fact.</p>

        <h2 id="hidden-cost">The Hidden Cost Most Practices Ignore</h2>

        <p>Most healthcare organizations track their denial rate. Very few track the full economic impact of denials. The denial rate tells you how many claims were rejected. It does not tell you how much each denial costs to resolve, how many denials your team never gets around to reworking, or how much revenue is permanently lost because denied claims fall through the cracks.</p>

        <p>The data on denial costs is sobering. According to Premier, Inc., the average administrative cost to rework a single denied claim rose from $43.84 in 2022 to $57.23 in 2023 — a 30% increase in one year (<a href="https://www.premierinc.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Premier, Inc.</a>). That is the cost of staff time to investigate the denial, determine the root cause, gather supporting documentation, correct the claim, and resubmit it. AHIMA Journal reports a broader range of $25 to $181 per denial depending on complexity (<a href="https://journal.ahima.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AHIMA Journal</a>). Complex denials involving clinical documentation or medical necessity reviews sit at the upper end of that range.</p>

        <p>At the macro level, the American Hospital Association estimates that hospitals collectively spend $19.7 billion per year on efforts to overturn denied claims (<a href="https://www.aha.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AHA</a>). That is $19.7 billion in pure administrative overhead — money spent not on patient care, not on facility improvement, not on staff compensation, but on convincing payers to pay for services that were already delivered.</p>

        <p>But the most damaging number is this one: between 35% and 60% of denied claims are never resubmitted, according to AHIMA Journal. These are claims for services that were legitimately provided to patients, billed to payers, denied, and then permanently abandoned. The revenue is gone. The work was done. The practice absorbed the cost of delivering the care and received nothing in return.</p>

        <p>Here is what this looks like in practical terms. A practice submitting 500 claims per month at the industry average denial rate of 11.8% will see approximately 59 claims denied. At the average rework cost of $57.23 per denial, the monthly rework expense is $3,376 — or approximately $40,500 per year in pure administrative cost. That figure accounts only for the claims that are actually reworked. If 35% to 60% of those 59 denials are never resubmitted, and the average claim value is $150, the practice permanently loses between $3,097 and $5,310 per month in unrecovered revenue — an additional $37,170 to $63,720 per year.</p>

        <p>Combined, a practice submitting just 500 claims per month faces an annual denial-related cost of $77,670 to $104,220 in rework expenses and lost revenue. Most practices do not track this number because it is distributed across billing staff salaries, reduced collections, and write-offs that get absorbed into general overhead. But it is real, it is recurring, and it is growing.</p>

        <h2 id="ohiohealth-case">How OhioHealth Cut Denials by 42%</h2>

        <p>OhioHealth is a large, not-for-profit health system based in Columbus, Ohio, with multiple hospitals and hundreds of care sites. Like most health systems, OhioHealth was experiencing rising denial rates driven by a fundamental challenge: patient registration data was based largely on patient self-reporting. Patients provided their insurance information verbally or on paper forms, and front-desk staff entered it into the system. The inevitable result was a steady stream of denials caused by incorrect demographics, lapsed coverage, wrong payer, and coordination of benefits errors.</p>

        <p>The details of this case come from an Experian Health case study on the Patient Access Curator platform (<a href="https://www.experian.com/healthcare" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Experian Health case study</a>).</p>

        <p><strong>Disclosure:</strong> This case study was published by Experian Health, the vendor of the Patient Access Curator platform. The results are publicly documented but originate from the vendor's own reporting. Readers should consider this context when evaluating the specific outcome figures.</p>

        <p>OhioHealth implemented the Patient Access Curator, an AI and machine learning platform that automates multiple front-end revenue cycle functions: insurance eligibility verification, coordination of benefits resolution, Medicare Beneficiary Identifier (MBI) lookup, demographic validation, and insurance discovery. Rather than relying on patient-reported data, the system cross-references patient information against payer databases, government sources, and proprietary data sets to verify and correct registration data before claims are submitted.</p>

        <h3>The Results</h3>

        <p>The documented outcomes across OhioHealth's system:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Registration and eligibility-related denials:</strong> reduced by 42%</li>
          <li><strong>Coordination of benefits (COB) denials:</strong> reduced by 36%</li>
          <li><strong>Termed insurance denials:</strong> reduced by 69%</li>
          <li><strong>Incorrect payer denials:</strong> reduced by 63%</li>
        </ul>

        <p>These are not marginal improvements. A 42% reduction in registration-related denials — the single largest category of preventable denials — represents a significant shift in revenue cycle performance. The 69% reduction in termed insurance denials is particularly notable because these are among the easiest denials to prevent with proper data: the insurance was terminated before the date of service, the information was available in payer systems, and no one checked.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>A 42% reduction in registration-related denials at OhioHealth demonstrates what happens when you replace patient self-reported data with automated verification against payer databases. The denials were never a billing problem — they were a data problem.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>The OhioHealth results are consistent with broader industry data on automation's impact. According to Experian Health's 2025 survey, 69% of providers currently using AI in their claims processes report reduced denials (<a href="https://www.experian.com/healthcare" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Experian Health, 2025</a>). Black Book Research found that 83% of organizations using AI-powered denial prevention tools saw at least a 10% reduction in denials within six months of implementation (<a href="https://blackbookmarketresearch.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Black Book Research</a>).</p>

        <p>The pattern across all of these data points is consistent: automation works for denial prevention because most denials are caused by data errors and process gaps that are inherently automatable. The claims are not being denied because the clinical work was unnecessary. They are being denied because the administrative infrastructure failed to capture, verify, or transmit the correct information at the right time.</p>

        <h2 id="automation-playbook">The Denial Prevention Playbook: 5 Automations That Work</h2>

        <p>The OhioHealth case focused on front-end verification — preventing denials at the point of registration. But a comprehensive denial prevention strategy addresses the full claims lifecycle. Here are the five automation categories that produce the most consistent results, mapped to the root causes identified earlier in this article.</p>

        <h3>1. Real-Time Eligibility Verification</h3>

        <p><strong>Root causes addressed:</strong> Incorrect demographics (#1), Eligibility/coverage errors (#2)</p>

        <p>Automated eligibility verification is the single highest-impact denial prevention tool. It works by querying payer databases at two points: batch verification 24 to 48 hours before scheduled appointments, and real-time verification at the point of registration. The system checks active coverage status, plan details, copay/deductible information, coordination of benefits, and demographic accuracy.</p>

        <p>This is exactly what drove OhioHealth's 42% reduction. The technology is mature, the payer connectivity is standardized through existing clearinghouse infrastructure, and the implementation timeline is measured in weeks, not months. For practices that still verify eligibility manually — or worse, do not verify it at all — this is the single most impactful automation to deploy first.</p>

        <h3>2. Automated Claim Scrubbing</h3>

        <p><strong>Root cause addressed:</strong> Coding and documentation errors (#3)</p>

        <p>Claim scrubbing engines run every claim through a rules engine before submission, checking for coding errors, modifier requirements, diagnosis-procedure mismatches, payer-specific billing rules, and known denial triggers. Claims that fail any rule are held for correction rather than submitted and denied.</p>

        <p>The economics are straightforward. Catching an error before submission costs essentially nothing — the scrubbing engine runs in milliseconds. Catching the same error after a denial costs $57.23 in rework (Premier, Inc.) and delays payment by weeks or months. First-pass acceptance rates typically improve from the 85% to 90% range to 95% or higher with automated scrubbing in place.</p>

        <h3>3. Prior Authorization Automation</h3>

        <p><strong>Root cause addressed:</strong> Missing or delayed prior authorization (#4)</p>

        <p>Prior authorization remains one of the most labor-intensive processes in healthcare administration. Automated authorization platforms determine whether a service requires prior auth based on the patient's specific plan, submit requests electronically, track approval status, and escalate deadlines. The key value is not just speed — it is completeness. Automation eliminates the scenario where a service requiring authorization is rendered without one because staff did not know the requirement existed.</p>

        <p>For a detailed look at how authorization automation performs in practice, see our analysis of <a href="/blog/healthcare-process-automation-results/">real results from 100 hospitals</a>, including the USA Health case where a 28-person team managed 130,000 authorizations per year with a 50% reduction in manual work.</p>

        <h3>4. AI-Powered Coding Review</h3>

        <p><strong>Root cause addressed:</strong> Insufficient clinical documentation (#5)</p>

        <p>AI-powered coding review tools analyze clinical documentation alongside selected codes, flagging potential issues before claims are submitted. These tools identify missing specificity, unsupported medical necessity, documentation gaps, and opportunities for more accurate code selection. They operate as a second pair of eyes on every claim, catching issues that human reviewers miss under time pressure.</p>

        <p>For data on how AI-powered tools are performing across healthcare organizations, including coding accuracy improvements and ROI figures, see our breakdown of <a href="/blog/healthcare-ai-automation-roi/">the real ROI of healthcare AI</a>.</p>

        <h3>5. Denial Tracking and Automated Appeals</h3>

        <p><strong>Problem addressed:</strong> 35% to 60% of denied claims never resubmitted (AHIMA Journal)</p>

        <p>This is the automation that recovers revenue from denials that do occur despite prevention efforts. Denial tracking systems automatically categorize every denial by root cause, route it to the appropriate queue, generate appeal letters with supporting documentation, and track resubmission through resolution. The critical function is ensuring that no denial falls through the cracks — directly addressing the AHIMA finding that up to 60% of denials are never resubmitted.</p>

        <p>Automated appeals are particularly effective for denials based on missing information or documentation, where the appeal is largely a matter of assembling and resubmitting the correct data. For clinical necessity denials, automation handles the administrative workflow while clinicians provide the medical justification, reducing the total time-to-appeal from weeks to days.</p>

        <p><strong>Note: The following is a hypothetical simulation, not a case study. It is provided to illustrate the methodology for calculating denial costs and potential automation impact. Actual results depend on practice size, payer mix, denial mix, and implementation quality. These figures should not be interpreted as guaranteed outcomes.</strong></p>

        <p>Consider a 5-physician practice with an average of 30 patient visits per day, 5 days per week, 44 weeks per year. At an average claim value of $150, the practice generates approximately 3,300 claims per month.</p>

        <h3>Current State: The Cost of Denials</h3>

        <p>At the industry average initial denial rate of 11.8% (Experian Health, 2025), this practice would see approximately 389 denied claims per month.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Revenue at risk:</strong> 389 denied claims at $150 average = $58,350 per month in claims that are not being paid</li>
          <li><strong>Permanently lost revenue:</strong> If 35% to 60% of those denials are never resubmitted (AHIMA Journal), that is 136 to 233 claims permanently abandoned = $20,400 to $34,950 per month in revenue that will never be recovered</li>
          <li><strong>Rework cost:</strong> For the claims that are reworked, the administrative cost is 389 claims at $57.23 each (Premier, Inc.) = $22,262 per month</li>
          <li><strong>Total monthly denial cost:</strong> $42,662 to $57,212</li>
          <li><strong>Total annual denial cost:</strong> $511,944 to $686,544</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Even at the conservative end of that range, this 5-physician practice is losing more than half a million dollars per year to claim denials. The number is large because it includes both the direct cost of rework and the indirect cost of revenue that is permanently lost. Most practices only track the rework cost — they never quantify the claims that were never resubmitted.</p>

        <h3>Projected State: Conservative Automation Impact</h3>

        <p>Based on the documented results from OhioHealth (42% reduction in registration-related denials) and the broader industry data (69% of AI-using providers reporting reduced denials, 83% seeing at least 10% reduction within six months), a conservative assumption is that automation could reduce the overall denial rate from 11.8% to approximately 7%.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Denied claims per month at 7%:</strong> 231 (down from 389)</li>
          <li><strong>Revenue at risk:</strong> $34,650 per month (down from $58,350)</li>
          <li><strong>Permanently lost revenue at 35%-60% abandonment:</strong> $12,127 to $20,790 per month (down from $20,400 to $34,950)</li>
          <li><strong>Rework cost:</strong> 231 claims at $57.23 = $13,220 per month (down from $22,262)</li>
          <li><strong>Total monthly denial cost:</strong> $25,347 to $34,010 (down from $42,662 to $57,212)</li>
          <li><strong>Annual savings from automation:</strong> $207,780 to $278,424</li>
        </ul>

        <p>At the midpoint, this practice would recover approximately $243,000 per year — enough to fund the automation platform, cover implementation costs, and produce a substantial net return. The payback period for most denial prevention platforms, based on these economics, is 3 to 6 months.</p>

        <p>For additional perspective on billing automation economics for smaller practices, see our analysis of <a href="/blog/healthcare-billing-automation-small-practice/">how small medical practices are cutting billing costs by 35% with automation</a>.</p>

        <p>These numbers are projections. Your practice's actual denial mix, payer composition, and current process efficiency will determine your specific results. But the methodology is sound: calculate your total denial cost (not just rework), apply a conservative improvement ratio based on documented outcomes, and compare the savings against the cost of automation. For most practices, the math is not close — the ROI is clear.</p>
